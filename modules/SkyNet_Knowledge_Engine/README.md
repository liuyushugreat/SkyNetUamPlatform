# Reasoning Engine Module

**Status**: 🚧 Placeholder (Not yet implemented)

This module is reserved for future AI reasoning and decision-making capabilities.

## Planned Features

- Multi-agent reasoning and coordination
- Decision trees and rule-based reasoning
- Integration with LLM-based reasoning engines
- Context-aware decision making for UAM operations

## Why This Directory Exists

This directory was created to reserve the namespace for future development. Git does not track empty directories, so a placeholder `__init__.py` file was added to ensure the directory structure is preserved in version control.
