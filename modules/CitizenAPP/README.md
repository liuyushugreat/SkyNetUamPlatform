# CitizenAPP (Not used)

This folder is **intentionally kept empty** for `modules/` cleanliness.

## Where the Citizen frontend lives

The Citizen UI is a **frontend app** and is located at:
- `apps/citizen-app/`

## Why not under `modules/`?

`modules/` is reserved for **reusable core capabilities** (backend/algorithms/domain cores),
while role-based UIs belong in `apps/`.
