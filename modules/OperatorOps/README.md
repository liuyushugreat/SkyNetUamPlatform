# OperatorOps (Not used)

This folder is **not** the location for Operator Ops UI code.

## Where the Operator Ops frontend lives

Operator Ops (UI) is located at:
- `apps/operator-ops/`

## Why not under `modules/`?

`modules/` is reserved for reusable core modules (domain logic / algorithms / services),
while UIs live in `apps/`.
